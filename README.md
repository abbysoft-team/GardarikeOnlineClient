This is Unity frontend for https://github.com/abbysoft-team/GardarikeOnlineServer

Gardarike Online is a new MMO strategy and rpg game. Currently it is in early stage of development. We have 2 developers working on the project, one at server side and one making frontend. What we want to achieve is to make gameplay unique but consistent between multiple platforms such as mobile devices and PC's. If you play on your mobile device, the game will be more like strategy economic building simulator. But once you switch platform to PC you will be able to enjoy plain old MMORPG genre expirience.

<b> Working on Android implementation </b>

What already done (v 0.0.3 - Sprint 3):

- Login screen with communication with server side
- Receiving map from server side and load in Unity
- Basic UI for displaying gold and population properties
- Ability to place one type of building on the map and send this info to the server
- Receiving build event from server

Roadmap:

see Projects for more info. Currently we're trying to apply some Scrum methodology (but a bit modified one)
